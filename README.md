# Abstract

Halloween, New Year, and Celebrations, Whatever the reason we love candy and the sugar in it. The habit of eating candy during festivals is very common for all age groups. The consumption of candy across the US has increased in the past decades. To meet the demand the production of different varieties of candies by different brands across the US has established factories. The industrial production (IP) index measures the real output of all relevant establishments located in the United States, regardless of their ownership, but not those located in U.S. territories. This dataset tracks industrial production every month from Mar 1st, 1973 to Mar 1st, 2023. Our aim is to explore the candy production dataset to understand the trend and seasonality and forecast the future production of candy from available data based on historical data
## What we did in this project

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
	- Clean the data by exploring the dataset possible empty or null values, mismatched dates

 
 2. **Exploration:**
	
	-  Visualization of trend, seasonality or noise from the dataset by exploring the time series component such as data plot, seasonality plot, trend plot and correlograms.
	
	
 3. **Model Development:**
	 - Developing forecasting models such as 
		 -  Naive forecast 
		 - Tailing MA 
		 - Two-level forecasting 
		 - ARIMA 
		 - Holt’s - Winter model

 4. **Model Evaluation:**
	 - Comparing the model’s performance by comparing the various metrics such as RMSE, MAPE and MPE
 5. **Future Forecasting:**
	  - Based on the final best model choice the forecasting for the future candy production will be done
